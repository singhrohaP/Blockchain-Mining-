# Final Project

For project 3 my group decided to implement a blockchain data structure on a peer-to-peer network. The group settled with ‘financial inclusion’ as a topic for global concern and managed to run the blockchain implementation code from a remote location using another pc as a node.

# Installation required

- python 3.6+

# Runing the project

After downloading all the python files on your PC, run the following commands on your terminal

- cd Project3
